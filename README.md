# composable-product-specs
A framework for writing product specs that humans and AI can actually understand.

If your product spec can’t be understood without AI, it’s already trash.

## Compospec & Atomic Design

Atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages (Atomic Design)

Product → Module → User Interface → Section → Component → Element (Compospec)

Hierarchical, structured, relational specs from high-level needs down to micro-level elements.

All content exists in cards, linked parent-to-child, with user flow diagrams automatically generated.

And AI ready output!
